# HRnet

HRnet is an application that manages employee records. The current version of the application is using jQuery for the front end, which leads to bugs and increased internal complaints.

My mission as a front-end developer is to :

- Convert the whole HRNet project to React
- Convert one of the four current jQuery plugins to a reusable React component and publish it on npm as a package
- Replace the 3 remaining jQuery plugins with React components
- Perform Lighthouse performance tests comparing the old and new application

## Launching the project (front-end)

- Fork this repository
- Clone it on your local system
- Use `npm install` to install the dependencies.
- Use `npm start` to run the front-end application.
